        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Discover the art of crafting our Banana Pudding, a delightful dessert made with precision and care. We start with layers of velvety vanilla custard, carefully placing ripe banana slices, and interspersing them with soft vanilla wafers. This isn't just a dessert; it's a journey through the process of creating a comforting classic. The harmonious blend of creamy custard and natural sweetness from the bananas is achieved through a meticulous approach. Join us in savoring the results of our thoughtful process â€“ a Banana Pudding that captures the essence of homemade perfection.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-urpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 ripe bananas, sliced</li>
            <li>1 box (11oz) vanilla</1i>
            <li>2 cups whipped cream (or whipped topping)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1. In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, flour, and salt.</li>
            <li>2. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, and then add them to the sugar mixture in the saucepan.</li>
            <li>3. Gradually whisk in the milk until the mixture is smooth.</li>
            <li>4. Place the saucepan over medium heat, and cook the mixture while stirring constantly until it thickens (about 8-10 minutes). Make sure it doesn't boil.</li>
            <li>5. Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>6. Allow the custard to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>7. In a trifle dish or a serving bowl, start layering the banana pudding. Begin with a layer of vanilla wafers, followed by a layer of sliced bananas, and then a layer of custard. Repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of custard on top.</li>
            <li>8. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>9. Before serving, top the banana pudding with a generous layer of whipped cream or whipped topping.</li>
            <li>10. Optionally, garnish with additional banana slices or crumbled vanilla wafers.</li>
        </ul>
