        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These easy cinnamon rolls are perfect for yeast beginners because they only require 1 rise. You have a few options for toppings. The recipe below includes a simple cream cheese icing, but we also love these with the coffee icing or vanilla icing that’s included in the recipe Notes below.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ul>
            <p>For the Cinnamon Filling:</p>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>

            <li>After the dough has risen, roll it out on a floured surface into a large rectangle.</li>
            <li>Spread softened butter over the dough, and then sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly.</li>
            <li>Starting from one long edge, roll the dough into a log.</li>
            <li>Cut the log into equal-sized rolls, about 12-15 rolls.</li>
            <li>Place the rolls in a greased baking pan.</li>
            <li>Cover and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes.</li>

            <p>For the Baking:</p>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes or until they are golden brown.</li>

            <p>For the Cheese Frosting:</p>
            <li>While the rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a bowl, beat together softened butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt until smooth.</li>
            <li>Once the rolls are out of the oven, let them cool slightly before spreading the cream cheese frosting over the top.</li>
            <li>Serve warm and enjoy your homemade cinnamon rolls!</li>
        </ul>
